<h1>title = "You want to know me?"</h1>


You know what they say? When someone ask *Tell me about yourself?*<br>
It almost feels like someone allowed them to sing an old song.<br>
Same lyrics with some variables in it.<br>
<br>
Name, Profession, Location.<br>
A formality which give a sense of '*We know this person*'.<br>
Funny isn't it? Because none of this basic indentity information truly describe a person.<br>
<br>
A person is more than just that - or is he?<br>

Whatever it is...<br>

I find it very boring.<br>
I believe knowing a person is an art. It's like an open world game,<br>
you don't know a person you explore him, more you explore, more you get comfortable.<br>
Thousands of stories and choices, one lead to another.<br>
A storyline with addition of some genes which builts a personality.<br>
<br>
You know what we learn when we play too many games?<br>
At some point we start recognizing patterns. We realize every game is just similar.<br>
It might look different from the outside, but inside it's always some programming logic.<br>
One can play this game for many reasons.<br>
It's like when a hacker understand a system mostly it's because he is curious.<br>
A mindset which seeks for the reason behind all the visible actions.<br>
But sometimes it's more than just that. Sometimes it's about getting the control<br>
or it can be for fixing a vurnerability.<br>
<br>
Most people don't play games out of love or care.<br>
It's always about power.<br>
<br>
When you truly know the game it's not very hard to kill, break or exploit it.<br>
<br>
Games can be revolutionary, ordinary, interesting, overrated, underrated, boring, full of shit.<br>
Infact some games are so horrible. It just needs to die ASAP.<br>
<br>
I know, I should now stop my crazy talk.<br>
It's time to fit myself into a frame built by society.<br>
A frame which make it easy to distinguish between Good or Bad, Right or Wrong.<br>
Some rules which give simplicity to this complex world and purpose to our lives.<br>
<br>
So you are here to know about me?<br>

I always make this game hard for others.<br>
As I said before a '*hacker don't just exploit, he also patch*'. The best way to patch your vurnerabilities -
is to stop living in *ignorance*. Start being honest with yourself.<br>
Sadly today our society is filled with fake people. No one is truly real.<br>
Our emotions like guilt, ego, anger, fear always stops us from looking at ourselves.<br>
We all lost touch with honesty the moment we lost our innocence.<br>
<br>
- I took red pill in life and I feel bad because I know how miserable you get with this.<br>
- When I imagine my life, I always see myself sitting in a dark room all night.<br>
  Doing some shit on computer while being connected to this crazy technology *Internet*.<br>
- Sometimes when I turn off my computer, I realize "I am completely alone". I lead myself into this.
  It's a choice. I might feel bad, but I never regret.<br>
- I always have mixed opinions, it help me making my game tough.<br> 
- I look things with different perspective, but it's hard, so I end up like most people, using the perspective
  which helps my agenda or emotions, *Perception* is a great game. When you master it you can justify all action
  in a way, it make sense.<br>
- I try my best to look for the cause rather than action or opinion.<br>
- I want to be a good person. But this world doesn't allow it.<br>
- I hate most people, I despise weakness. But I also pity occasionally.<br>
- I love good humor, always try to make clever jokes. It help me enjoying my life.<br>
- Yes, I am full of hate and darkness. I am full of negativity. But someone have to be.<br>
- If I am reacting on something. It's just me trying to have fun out of good mood. Because deep down inside.
  I never give a fuck about things I can't control or change. I just look.<br>
- Sometimes I wonder, Who I hate more? powerful people or weak people.<br>
- I always try to never look for validations from the others.<br>
- I believe in skills, talent, knowledge. The only true way to make this world a
  better place is doing what you love.<br>
- I always look what drives a person everyday?<br>
  Money, Greed, Love, Fear, Compulsion, Passion. Some drives are good, some are bad.<br>
- I believe in true freedom. Freedom of mind.<br>

I don't want to be ordinary, I want to make a difference, be great. But at what cost?
> Name one hero, who was happy?<br>

(it was a rhetorical question)<br>
