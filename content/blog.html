	Blog: 
		Morning 11:30, I was sitting on my Swing-Board when I came across this Idea of re-making my persnol Website.<br>
		It was a Lot of work today but I made this website any way. First of all I had to Completely start this Project from scratch,<br>
		so I Started by searching for some persnol websites. Then I came across *Youtuber*bugswriter's Website. Dunno if you follow him <br>
		but he is a great guy His channel is Linux Based(arch jokes). Then I copied his code (the base obviously and cmmon' <br>
		my website is totally diffrent). So proceeding further, I replaced the Bio-G with mine and then the other information and codes.<br> 
		<br>
		Same day I had a Tution class exam, Went great. But Yesterday's exam result came #ShittyFaceEmoji# I got 12.5/45 still I was ranked 3rd in class<br>
		I mean that is alot weird. Now late-afternoon 5:10 I arrived at home and after refreshing I told my mom about this and guess what she said ? <br>
		"Get is Signed by your Father." Now you know it and i Know it what is next... wish me luck.
		<br>
		So, this is the story of my day when I truely created this website. I dunno If any one would be intreasted in learning this information but still<br>
		it is there.
